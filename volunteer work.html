<li>Hour Of Code:</li>
<br>
<p>The Hour Of Code is a one hour event that took place at North High School. We would help kids that signed up to be apart of this one hour event. This event showed kids how to code with coding websites like Scratch.</p>

<li>Open House:</li><br>
<p>I recently helped Excelsior with an Open House. It was to get the upcoming 9th graders to come and join our program and introduce what we do, for instance like the robotics club. </p>

<li>Gidney Science Expo:</li>
<p> This years GAMS Tech Magnet School held a Science Expo which was a big activity for kids to use candy for science.
There was multiple stations where kid's would rotate too and the station that I worked at was a Skittles Station. This station
was about placing skittles in water and waiting to see the color come off and sometimes the children could see, the S come off
from the skittle. The event was an educational and fun experieince for the volunteers and children.

   They were able to make chocolate and talk about how it turned from a liquid into a solid. It was a pretty fun event.</p>
